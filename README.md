# Image-Classification-with-pretrained-InceptionV3-Network

This project aims to impart the knowledge of how to access the pre-trained models(here we get pre-trained Inception model) from Keras of TensorFlow 2, and appreciate its powerful classification capacity by making the model predict the class of an input image.
